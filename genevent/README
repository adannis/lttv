The 'genevent' program parses event descriptions and generates 
the inline functions to record events in the kernel.

Right now, the program can only parse simple structure, if a 
structure has a nested structure, it will not work.

There are several files in the directory:
 genevent.c, genevent.h, crc32.tab, parser.c and parser.h

In fact, crc32.tab, parser.c and parser.h are the same files as  
those in LTT library.

'core.xml' is an example event description file.

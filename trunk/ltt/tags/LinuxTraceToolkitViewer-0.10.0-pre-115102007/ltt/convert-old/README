The application 'convert' is used to convert an old format tracefile into a new 
format tracefile. It has several commandline parameters, the first is process file 
name, the second is a number (the number of cpu in the machine), the third is
the first tracefile name(corresponding to the first cpu), the fourth is the 
second tracefile name(corresponding to the second cpu), the fifth is ...,   
the last one is root directory for the new trace (this can be omitted, 
by default it is 'foo')

The command line looks like this:      
 ./convert processfile_name the_number_of_cpu first_tracefile_name, ..., foo_dir

There is also a script file 'sysInfo' which is used to get system information
from your local machine, the information is saved in 'sysInfo.out' which will 
be read by 'convert' later. If the old tracefile is generated by other machine,
then the 'sysInfo.out' should be gotten from that machine.

'core.xml' is a facility file, after run 'convert', it needs to be copied to
'foo_dir/eventdefs' directory

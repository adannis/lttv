<h1>Linux Trace Toolkit Quickstart</h1>


Author : Mathieu Desnoyers, September 2005<br>
Last update : January 9th, 2009<br>

<p>
This document is made of four parts : the first one explains how to install
LTTng and LTTV from Debian and RPM binary packages, the second one explains how
to install LTTng and LTTV from sources and the third one describes the steps
to follow to trace a system and view it. The fourth and last part explains
briefly how to add a new trace point to the kernel and to user space
applications.

<p>
What you will typically want is to read sections 2 and 3 : install LTTng from
sources and use it.

<p>
These operations are made for installing the LTTng 0.74 tracer on a linux 2.6.X
kernel. You will also find instructions for installation of LTTV 0.12.x : the
Linux Trace Toolkit Viewer. 

<p>
To see the list of compatibilities between LTTng, ltt-control, LTTV and
markers-userspace, please refer to :
<a
href="http://ltt.polymtl.ca/svn/trunk/lttv/doc/developer/lttng-lttv-compatibility.html">LTTng+LTTV versions compatibility</a>


<p>
The following lttng patch is necessary to have the tracing hooks in the kernel.
The following ltt-control module controls the tracing.

<p>
Required programs and libraries are assumed to be automatically installed in an
installation with Debian or RPM packages. In the case of an installation from
sources, the dependencies are listed.


** Current development status **<br>
<br>
LTTng :<br>
Supported architectures : 
<li> x86 32/64 bits
<li> PowerPC 32 and 64 bits
<li> ARM (with limited timestamping precision, e.g. 1HZ. Need
architecture-specific support for better precision)
<li> MIPS
<br>
LTTV :<br>
supported architectures :<br>
<li> Intel 32/64 bits
<li> PowerPC 32 and 64 bits
<li> Possibly others. Takes care of endianness and type size difference between
the LTTng traces and the LTTV analysis tool.

***********************************************************
** Section 1 * Installation from Debian or RPM packages  **
***********************************************************

* Create custom LTTV Debian packages

Use : dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

You should then have your LTTV .deb files created for your architecture.

* Create custom LTTng packages

For building LTTng Debian packages :

Get the build tree with patches applies as explained in section 2.

make menuconfig (or xconfig or config) (customize your configuration)
make-kpkg kernel_image

You will then see your freshly created .deb in /usr/src. Install it with
dpkg -i /usr/src/(image-name).deb

Then, follow the section "Editing the system wide configuration" in section 2.


***********************************************************
** Section 2 * Installation from sources                 **
***********************************************************

* Prerequisites

Tools needed to follow the package download steps :

o wget
o bzip2
o gzip
o tar

You have to install the standard development libraries and programs necessary
to compile a kernel :

(from Documentation/Changes in the Linux kernel tree)
o  Gnu C                  2.95.3                  # gcc --version
o  Gnu make               3.79.1                  # make --version
o  binutils               2.12                    # ld -v
o  util-linux             2.10o                   # fdformat --version
o  module-init-tools      0.9.10                  # depmod -V

You might also want to have libncurses5 to have the text mode kernel
configuration menu, but there are alternatives.

Prerequisites for LTTV 0.x.x installation are :

gcc 3.2 or better
gtk 2.4 or better development libraries
  (Debian : libgtk2.0, libgtk2.0-dev)
  (Fedora : gtk2, gtk2-devel)
  note : For Fedora users : this might require at least core 3 from Fedora,
  or you might have to compile your own GTK2 library.
glib 2.4 or better development libraries
  (Debian : libglib2.0-0, libglib2.0-dev)
  (Fedora : glib2, glib2-devel)
libpopt development libraries
  (Debian : libpopt0, libpopt-dev)
  (Fedora : popt)
libpango development libraries
  (Debian : libpango1.0, libpango1.0-dev)
  (Fedora : pango, pango-devel)
libc6 development librairies 
  (Debian : libc6, libc6-dev)
  (Fedora : glibc, glibc)

* Editing the system wide configuration

You must activate debugfs and specify a mount point. This is typically done in
fstab such that it happens at boot time.

If you have never used DebugFS before, these operation would do this for you :

mkdir /mnt/debugfs
cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.lttng.bkp
echo "debugfs         /mnt/debugfs    debugfs rw              0       0"  >> /etc/fstab

then, rebooting or issuing the following command will activate debugfs :

mount /mnt/debugfs

You need to load the LTT modules to be able to control tracing from user
space. This is done by issuing the following commands. Note however
these commands load all LTT modules. Depending on what options you chose to
compile statically, you may not need to issue all these commands. 

modprobe ltt-trace-control
modprobe ltt-marker-control
modprobe ltt-tracer
modprobe ltt-serialize
modprobe ltt-relay
modprobe ipc-trace
modprobe kernel-trace
modprobe mm-trace
modprobe net-trace
modprobe fs-trace
modprobe jbd2-trace
modprobe ext4-trace
modprobe syscall-trace
modprobe trap-trace
#if locking tracing is wanted, uncomment the following
#modprobe lockdep-trace

If you want to have complete information about the kernel state (including all
the process names), you need to load the ltt-statedump module. This is done by
issuing the command :

modprobe ltt-statedump

You can automate at boot time loading the ltt-control module by :

cp /etc/modules /etc/modules.bkp
echo ltt-trace-control >> /etc/modules
echo ltt-marker-control >> /etc/modules
echo ltt-tracer >> /etc/modules
echo ltt-serialize >> /etc/modules
echo ltt-relay >> /etc/modules
echo ipc-trace >> /etc/modules
echo kernel-trace >> /etc/modules
echo mm-trace >> /etc/modules
echo net-trace >> /etc/modules
echo fs-trace >> /etc/modules
echo jbd2-trace >> /etc/modules
echo ext4-trace >> /etc/modules
echo syscall-trace >> /etc/modules
echo trap-trace >> /etc/modules
#if locking tracing is wanted, uncomment the following
#echo lockdep-trace >> /etc/modules


* Getting and installing the ltt-control package (on the traced machine)
(note : the ltt-control package contains lttd and lttctl. Although it has the
same name as the ltt-control kernel module, they are *not* the same thing.)
su -
cd /usr/src
wget http://ltt.polymtl.ca/lttng/ltt-control-0.x-xxxx2006.tar.gz
gzip -cd ltt-control-0.x-xxxx2008.tar.gz | tar xvof -
cd ltt-control-0.x-xxxx2006
(refer to README to see the development libraries that must be installed on you
system)
./configure
make
make install


* Userspace tracing

Make sure you selected the kernel menuconfig option :
    <M> or <*> Support logging events from userspace
And that the ltt-userspace-event kernel module is loaded if selected as a
module.

Simple userspace tracing is available through
echo "some text to record" > /mnt/debugfs/ltt/write_event

It will appear in the trace under event :
channel : userspace
event name : event


* Getting and installing the LTTV package (on the visualisation machine, same or
  different from the visualisation machine)

su -
cd /usr/src
wget http://ltt.polymtl.ca/packages/lttv-0.x.xx-xxxx2008.tar.gz
gzip -cd lttv-0.x.xx-xxxx2008.tar.gz | tar xvof -
cd lttv-0.x.xx-xxxx2008
(refer to README to see the development libraries that must be installed on your
system)
./configure
make
make install


* Getting and installing the markers-userspace package for user space tracing
(experimental)
See http://ltt.polymtl.ca/packages/markers-userspace-0.5.tar.bz2 or more recent.



***********************************************************
** Section 3 * Using LTTng and LTTV                      **
***********************************************************

* IMPORTANT : Arm Linux Kernel Markers after each boot

ltt-armall

* Use graphical LTTV to control tracing and analyse traces

lttv-gui (or /usr/local/bin/lttv-gui)
  - Spot the "Tracing Control" icon : click on it
      (it's a traffic light icon)
    - enter the root password
    - click "start"
    - click "stop"
    - Yes
      * You should now see a trace

* Use text mode LTTng to control tracing

The tracing can be controlled from a terminal by using the lttctl command (as
root).

Start tracing :

lttctl -C -w /tmp/trace1 trace1

Stop tracing and destroy trace channels :

lttctl -D trace1

see lttctl --help for details.

(note : to see if the buffers has been filled, look at the dmesg output after
lttctl -R or after stopping tracing from the GUI, it will show an event lost
count. If it is the case, try using larger buffers. See lttctl --help to learn 
how. lttv now also shows event lost messages in the console when loading a trace
with missing events or lost subbuffers.)

* Use text mode LTTV

Feel free to look in /usr/local/lib/lttv/plugins to see all the text and
graphical plugins available.

For example, a simple trace dump in text format is available with :

lttv -m textDump -t /tmp/trace

see lttv -m textDump --help for detailed command line options of textDump.

It is, in the current state of the project, very useful to use "grep" on the
text output to filter by specific event fields. You can later copy the timestamp
of the events to the clipboard and paste them in the GUI by clicking on the
bottom right label "Current time". Support for this type of filtering should
be added to the filter module soon.

* Hybrid mode

Starting from LTTng 0.5.105 and ltt-control 0.20, a new mode can be used :
hybrid. It can be especially useful when studying big workloads on a long period
of time.

When using this mode, the most important, low rate control information will be
recorded during all the trace by lttd (i.e. process creation/exit). The high
rate information (i.e. interrupt/traps/syscall entry/exit) will be kept in a
flight recorder buffer (now named flight-channelname_X).

The following lttctl commands take an hybrid trace :

Create trace channel, start lttd on normal channels, start tracing:
lttctl -C -w /tmp/trace2 -o channel.kernel.overwrite=1 trace2

Stop tracing, start lttd on flight recorder channels, destroy trace channels :
lttctl -D -w /tmp/trace2 trace2

Each "overwrite" channel is flight recorder channel.

* Flight recorder mode

The flight recorder mode writes data into overwritten buffers for all channels,
including control channels, except for the facilities tracefiles. It consists of
setting all channels to "overwrite".

The following lttctl commands take a flight recorder trace :

lttctl -C -w /tmp/trace3 -o channel.all.overwrite=1 trace3
...
lttctl -D -w /tmp/trace3 trace3


**************************************************************
** Section 4 * Adding new instrumentations with the markers **
**************************************************************

See Documentation/markers.txt and Documentation/tracepoints.txt in your kernel
tree.

* Add new events to userspace programs with userspace markers
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/packages/

Get the latest markers-userspace-*.tar.bz2 and see the Makefile and examples. It
allows inserting markers in executables and libraries, currently only on x86_32
and x86_64.

As of january 28 2004, the Linux Trace Toolkit viewer is nearing feature
completeness for the first release. A few features need some additional work.
Thereafter, polishing, stabilizing, and documentation will take place before
adding new features. It can be considered pre alpha but usable for displaying
detailed event lists. Furthermore, it may be used to plan the development of
new modules for the viewer.

The underlying libltt library is fairly stable and mature. It may be considered
alpha.

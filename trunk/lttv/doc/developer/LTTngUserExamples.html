<h1>Examples of LTTng use in the field</h1>
<p>
A few examples of successful LTTng users :

<ul>
<li> Google are deploying LTTng on their servers. They want to use it to
  monitor their production servers (with flight recorder mode tracing)
  and to help them solve hard to reproduce problems. They have had
  success with such tracing approach to fix "rare disk delay" issues and
  VM-related issues presented in this article :
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://ltt.polymtl.ca/papers/bligh-Reprint.pdf">Linux Kernel
Debugging on Google-sized clusters at Ottawa Linux
    Symposium 2007</a>
</ul>
<li> IBM Research have had problems with Commercial Scale-out applications,
  which are being an increasing trend to split large server workloads.
  They used LTTng successfully to solve a distributed filesystem-related
  issue. It's presented in the same paper above.

<li> Autodesk, in the development of their next-generation of Linux
  audio/video edition applications, used LTTng extensively to solve
  soft real-time issues they had. Also presented in the same paper.

<li> Wind River included LTTng in their Linux distribution so their
  clients, already familiar to Wind River own tracing solution in
  VxWorks, car have the same kind of feature they have relied on for a
  long time.

<li> Montavista have integrated LTTng in their distribution for the same
  reasons. It's used by Sony amongst others.

<li> SuSE are currently integrating LTTng in their next SLES distribution,
  because their clients asking for solutions which supports a kernel
  closer to real-time need such tools to debug their problems.

<li> A project between Ericsson, the Canadian Defense, NSERC and various
  universities is just starting. It aims at monitoring and debugging
  multi-core systems and provide automated and help user system behavior
  analysis.

<li> Siemens have been using LTTng internally for quite some time now.

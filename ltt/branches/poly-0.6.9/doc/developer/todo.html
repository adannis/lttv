<h1>Roadmap</h1>
        
<p>
As of january 28 2004, the short term development plans include the following
items.

<UL>
<LI> Add the copyright notices in each program file.
<LI> Insure that the coding practices are being implemented.
<LI> Polish the visual appearance: icons for the tabs and buttons,
     background, lines and labels in the control flow viewer...
<LI> When a trace is opened, start a background thread to precompute 
     the system state and memorize it after each ~100 000 events. 
     Have the option to save the precomputed state when a trace is closed. 
     Use the precomputed state if available when opening a trace or 
     seeking in a trace. Use the same thread for computing statistics.
<LI> Update module.c to ease changing a module into a builtin feature.
<LI> Split processTrace into tracecontext and processtrace.
<LI> Insure that g_info logging is generally available but off by default.
<LI> Document each header file such that developer documentation can
     be extracted automatically using 
     <A href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</A>.
<LI> Complete the user and developer documentation.
<LI> Test the viewer on large SMP traces. Insure that 2GB files do not cause
     crashes. Note and fix unduly long delays. 
<LI> Add C99 test (declaration of variable inside a function) to configure.in

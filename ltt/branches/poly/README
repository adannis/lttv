* Compiling

Some development libraries are needed for compiling :

gtk 2 development libraries (libgtk2.0-dev)
glib 2 development libraries (libglib2.0-dev)
libpopt development libraries (libpopt-dev)
libpango development libraries (libpango-dev)

To compile the source tree from a tarball, simply follow these steps :

- run ./configure
- make
- make install

After running ./configure, you can also go in specific subdirectories and
use make, make install.


* Source Tree Structure

This is a sample of the suggested tree for Linux Trace Toolkit.

LibLTT : Libraries used for LTT.
README : This file. Introduction pointing to specific resources in the tree.
debian : debian config files.
doc :    LTT Documentation.
doc/user :      User related documentation.
doc/developer : Developer related documentation.
kernel : LTT kernel patches.
lttd :   Linux Trace Toolkit daemon.
lttv :   Linux Trace Toolkit visualizer/analyzer.
lttv/plugins :  Linux Trace Toolkit visualizer plugins.
specs :  RPM config files.


* For Developers

This source tree is based on the autotools suite from GNU to simplify
portability. Here are some things you should have on your system in order to
compile the subversion repository tree :


GNU autotools (automake-1,7, autoconf2.50, autoheader2.50)
(make sure your system wide "automake" points to version 1.7!)
GNU Libtool
(for more information, go to http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)

If you get the tree from the repository, you will need to use the autogen.sh
script. It calls all the GNU tools needed to prepare the tree configuration.

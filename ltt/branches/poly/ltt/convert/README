The application 'convert' is used to convert an old format tracefile into a new 
format tracefile. It has four commandline parameters, the first is tracefile 
name, the second is process file, the third is a number (the number of cpu in the machine), 
the last one is root directory for the new trace (this can be omitted, 
by default it is 'foo')

The command line looks like this:      
        convert tracefile_name processfile_name the_number_of_cpu foo_dir

There is also a script file 'sysInfo' which is used to get system information
from your local machine, the information is saved in 'sysInfo.out' which will 
be read by 'convert' later. If the old tracefile is generated in other machine,
then the 'sysInfo.out' should be gotten from that machine.

'core.xml' is a facility file, after run 'convert', it needs to be copied to
'foo_dir/eventdefs' directory

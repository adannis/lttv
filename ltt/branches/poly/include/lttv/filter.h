#ifndef FILTER_H
#define FILTER_H

/* A filter expression consists in nested AND, OR and NOT expressions
   involving boolean relation (>, >=, =, !=, <, <=) between event fields and 
   specific values. It is compiled into an efficient data structure which
   is used in functions to check if a given event or tracefile satisfies the
   filter.

   The grammar for filters is:

   filter = expression

   expression = "(" expression ")" | "!" expression | 
                expression "&&" expression | expression "||" expression |
                simpleExpression

   simpleExpression = fieldPath op value

   fieldPath = fieldComponent [ "." fieldPath ]

   fieldComponent = name [ "[" integer "]" ]

   value = integer | double | string

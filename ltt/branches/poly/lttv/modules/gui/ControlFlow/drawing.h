#define SAFETY 50 // safety pixels at right and bottom of pixmap buffer

/* This part of the viewer does :
 * Draw horizontal lines, getting graphic context as arg.
 * Copy region of the screen into another.
 * Modify the boundaries to reflect a scale change. (resize)
 * Refresh the physical screen with the pixmap
 * A helper function is provided here to convert from time to process
 * identifier to pixels and the contrary (will be useful for mouse selection).
 * Insert an empty square in the drawing, moving the bottom part.
 *
 * Note: The last point is exactly why it would not be so easy to add the
 * vertical line functionnality as in the original version of LTT. In order
 * to do so, we should keep all processes in the list for the duration of
 * all the trace instead of dynamically adding and removing them when we
 * scroll. Another possibility is to redraw all the visible area when a new
 * process is added to the list. The second solution seems more appropriate
 * to me.
 * 
 *
 * The pixmap used has the width of the physical window, but the height
 * of the shown processes.

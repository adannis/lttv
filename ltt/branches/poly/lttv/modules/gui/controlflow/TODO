TODO list on control flow view by Mathieu Desnoyers


- Split in process view and CPU ciew :
  - remove process 0 from the process list
  - add a new viewer to the module :
    - cfv.c -> new cpuctl.c : core of the view
    - eventhooks.c -> cpuhooks.c : draw cpu states
    - processlist.c -> cpulist.c

- Check cfv for stability, modules load/unload, viewer start (many:3+), stop,
  memory leaks; standardize module unloading : in all cases they should call
  main window's API for viewer widget removal, and only then the memory should
  be released (from the call of the main window).

- Add viewer selected signal (call main window's API function)
- When viewing a big trace, use the fact that the drawing cannot be more
  precise than the amount of horizontal pixels it has : "jump" from one event
  to another, converting pixels to time in the trace. It will use efficiently
  the "saved state" functionnality of underlying state.c.

- Modify widgets'organization so the time bar is not affected by scrolling :
  it may need to separate process list from the drawing area (not in a
  scrolled window anymore). The idea would be to use a scrolled window for
  the drawing area, put it in the right side of a hbox, put the tree view
  in the left side and then connect the tree view's adjustment to the
  scrolled window's scroll bar.

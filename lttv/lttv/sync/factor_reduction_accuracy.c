/*
 * Finalize the factor reduction
 *
 * Calculate a resulting offset and drift for each trace.
 *
 * Traces are assembled in groups. A group is an "island" of nodes/traces that
 * exchanged messages. A reference is determined for each group by using a
 * shortest path search based on the accuracy of the approximation. This also
 * forms a tree of the best way to relate each node's clock to the reference's
 * based on the accuracy. Sometimes it may be necessary or advantageous to
 * propagate the factors through intermediary clocks. Resulting factors for
 * each trace are determined based on this tree.
 *
 * This part was not the focus of my research. The algorithm used here is
 * inexact in some ways:
 * 1) The reference used may not actually be the best one to use. This is
 *    because the accuracy is not corrected based on the drift during the
 *    shortest path search.
 * 2) The min and max factors are not propagated and are no longer valid.
 * 3) Approximations of different types (ACCURATE and APPROXIMATE) are compared
 *    together. The "accuracy" parameters of these have different meanings and
 *    are not readily comparable.
 *
 * Nevertheless, the result is satisfactory. You just can't tell "how much" it
 * is.
 *
 * Two alternative (and subtly different) ways of propagating factors to
 * preserve min and max boundaries have been proposed, see:
 * [Duda, A., Harrus, G., Haddad, Y., and Bernard, G.: Estimating global time
 * in distributed systems, Proc. 7th Int. Conf. on Distributed Computing
 * Systems, Berlin, volume 18, 1987] p.304
 *
 * [Jezequel, J.M., and Jard, C.: Building a global clock for observing
 * computations in distributed memory parallel computers, Concurrency:
 * Practice and Experience 8(1), volume 8, John Wiley & Sons, Ltd Chichester,
 * 1996, 32] Section 5; which is mostly the same as

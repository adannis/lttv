</head><body>

<h1>LTTng User-space Tracing Design</h1>

<p>
Earlier versions of LTTng contained simple, system call based, tracepoints and fast,
user-space buffered, tracepoints for user-space tracing. During the kernel inclusion phase
of LTTng, extensive rework and modularization of the kernel tracing portion was undertaken.
This phase is well under way and several portions have been included already in the mainline kernel.
The rework of the  kernel tracing infrastructure will shortly thereafter be ported to fast user-space
tracing.
This fast user-space tracing scheme uses a direct function call to write events into buffers
mapped in user-space. This should be an order of magnitude faster than the
current Dtrace implementation (c.f.
<a href="http://ltt.polymtl.ca/tracingwiki/index.php/DTrace">Dtrace information
on the TracingWiki</a>) which uses a breakpoint to
perform both dynamic and static user-space tracing. Performance comparison of
a function call vs the int3 approach is available at
<a href="http://sourceware.org/ml/systemtap/2006-q3/msg00793.html">Markers vs
int3 performance comparison</a> (see "Conclusion").

Libmarkers will provide applications with user-space Markers and Tracepoints
declarations, such that programmers will be able to insert Markers and Tracepoints in their
libraries and applications. User-space Tracepoints and Markers, analogous to Kernel Tracepoints and Markers,
define program locations and arguments provided. Libmarkers will also
provide utility functions to enumerate, activate and deactivate tracepoints and markers in the
process, and to associate probes with any tracepoint or marker.

Libtracing will provide the infrastructure to allocate buffers, define event types, write event
metadata and data to the buffers, and get notification when buffers are full. The initial implementation
will simply use one set of buffers per process. Subsequent more optimized versions will allocate one
set of buffers per thread; one set of buffers per CPU would be desirable but user-space programs cannot check
or control CPU migration without resorting to more costly bus locking operations or system calls. The library
provides a generic probe for markers which, when connected, generates an event in the buffer each time the marker
is encountered.

Finally, libtracingcontrol opens a connection allowing a separate process (e.g. LTTng daemon, Eclipse, GDB) to control the 
tracing within the application. Through this connection, the remote process can:

<UL>
<li> list the available Markers and Tracepoints;
</li><li> dynamically load a library (presumably containing probes to connect);
</li><li> connect a probe to a Tracepoint or Marker;
</li><li> activate a Tracepoint or Marker;
</li><li> initialize the tracing buffers;
</li><li> retrieve the content of the tracing buffers;
</li><li> flush the tracing buffers;
</li><li> finalize the tracing buffers;
</li>
</UL>

In the first version, libtracingcontrol will simply contain the basic functionality
required to generate a trace of the Markers encountered. Subsequent versions will interact with
other probing mechanisms like GDB Tracepoints, user-space SystemTap and those defined by virtual 
machines (e.g. Java Virtual Machine, Python, Errlang...).
</p><p>
Tracing of Java application is planned to be done through a JNI interface.
Linking standard low-level C tracing library to the application within a JNI
adaptation class will be required to trace Java events. This has been prototyped
in the past. The work is available
<a href="http://ltt.polymtl.ca/svn/trunk/obsolete/ltt-usertrace/java/">here</a>
for older LTTng versions.
<p></p>
The principle of operation of libtracingcontrol is that
when the instrumented application starts, a pipe is opened to allow external
tracing control. Asynchronous notification is requested when commands arrive in
the pipe, and a signal handler is installed for SIGIO (or a carefully chosen
chainable signal number). Every time such signal is received, the runtime
library checks for commands received on the external tracing control pipe.
The application may also spontaneously provide information to the remote control process
through the pipe:

</p><ul></li><li> a buffer is full;
</li><li> new tracepoints or markers are appearing or disappearing, because modules are
  dynamically loaded or unloaded;
</li></ul>
<p>
In addition, the tracing control application should be notified when the
application exits (to save the content of buffers if the application is
crashing) or forks (to trace the child as well if needed). 
Such notification may be obtained through utrace.

</p><p>
In summary, a user-space application linking with libmarkers may contain static
instrumentation, Tracepoints and Markers, just like the kernel with Kernel Markers and Tracepoints.
The application can exploit this instrumentation itself or link with libtracing and have tracing probes
connected to each Marker. Other instrumentation mechanisms, like the GCC instrument-function option, or hooks
inserted by a JIT compiler, can also use libtracing to define and write event to the trace buffers. 
Finally, libtracingcontrol, analogous to GDB stubs, allows the remote control of the tracing by remote
monitoring or debugging frameworks.
